# MovieServise
Get information about movies using our library as a wrapper for the OMDb and TMDb services.

Go to MovieService/MovieService/bin/Debug to get the MovieService.dll.
If are using Visual Studio 2015 we recommend you follow our [video demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-qkVPpV-GY) to learn more about integrating our library into your project.
